For example, the state $|\\psi\\rangle=(|0\\rangle+|1\\rangle)/\\sqrt{2}$ is represented by the statevector $|\\psi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$.

Since we have two qubits, **we now have 4 basis states**, corresponding to the **4 possible outputs** we can get when we measure the 2 qubits: $|00\\rangle$, $|01\\rangle$, $|10\\rangle$, and $|11\\rangle$. Therefore, the **statevector for a 2-qubit state has 4 entries**. For example, the state $|\\psi\\rangle=\\frac{1}{2}|00\\rangle+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}|01\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}|10\\rangle-\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}|11\\rangle$ would be represented by the statevector $|\\psi\\rangle=\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\end{pmatrix}$. Here, the first entry is the amplitude of the $|00\\rangle$ state, the second entry is the amplitude of the $|01\\rangle$ state, the third entry is the amplitude of the $|10\\rangle$ state, and the fourth entry is the amplitude of the $|11\\rangle$.\n",

In lecture we had used `QasmSimulator`, which is intended to return the results of measurements, and therefore we had to add classical bits and measurements to our circuit."

    "1. Qiskit is an open-source Python library that allows us to create and run quantum circuits and algorithms\n",

    "2. Quiskit Terra provides tools to build and manipulate quantum circuits. We use `QuantumCircuit(n)` to create a quantum circuit with `n` qubits\n",

    "3. Qiskit Aer provides tools to simulate quantum circuits. `statevetor_simulator` is one simulation tool, that returns the exact state of the qubits at the output of the circuit.\n",

    "4. We can add single qubit gates like H and X, and multi-qubit gates like CX, to the circuit using `<circuitname>.x(<qubit index>)`, `<circuitname>.h(<qubit index>)`, and `<circuitname>.cx(<control qubit index, target qubit index>)`"
